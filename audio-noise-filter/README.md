# 🔇 SonicScope – Real-Time Audio Signal Visualizer & Editor

An interactive Python GUI app to record, analyze, and manipulate audio signals in real-time. Visualize signals in the **time and frequency domains**, apply **transformations**, and explore signal behavior using **FFT and waveform plots**.

## 🚀 Features

* 🔴 **Record** stereo audio (5 seconds) from your microphone
* ▶️ **Play** both input and output signals
* 📈 **Visualize** signals in:

  * Time domain
  * Frequency domain via FFT
* 📤 **Upload** and analyze external WAV files
* ⚙️ **Transform** your signal with:

  * Amplitude **scaling**
  * Time-domain **shifting**
* 🎛️ **Interactive Filter Menu** (under development):

  * High-Pass, Low-Pass, Band-Pass, Band-Stop
  * FIR and IIR filter designs
* 🧠 **Modular architecture** with centralized config and better separation of logic
* 🛠️ Built using **NiceGUI**, **NumPy**, **SciPy**, **Plotly**, and **PyDub**

## 📚 Lessons Learned

While building this project, I discovered key differences in how stereo audio is handled in NumPy arrays and SciPy WAV readers. Flattening stereo channels using `np.fromstring()` led to **incorrect playback speed** and signal length. The fix involved **selecting one audio channel (`data[:, 0]`)** and ensuring memory contiguity using `np.ascontiguousarray()`.

## 🔍 FFT & Domain Plots

The **FFT** feature computes the frequency spectrum of your signal and overlays it in the Frequency Domain tab. Plots are interactive and powered by **Plotly**, giving real-time signal feedback for deeper analysis.
